# Energy Data Test

This a given challenge give to me by x company:
1. x_energy.py file with ETL and 24 hour detection & data storage outputs
2. analysis.py file which outputs .html visualizations using csv 

### General Info
Given these intrcutions, to upscale I could implement machine learning and more
features for condition monitoring. I would also include a database like oracle or PostgresSQL for data storage.
With proper and extensive testing in QA, any modifactions can be made and user feedback would be essential
to make aditions or changes, including visualizations. 
In addition, to achieve real-time analytics we would deploy this in a way where the user is able to manipulate
thresholds, conditions or runtime.
Lastly, to make best use I would want to make an app or dashboard where anomalies can be best traced and visualized per grid, site and home.
This way, we can get an overall summary of the whole fleet.

Other features:
- statistics
- predictive insights
- ML 

Some other anomalies we could look at:
- signals from home batteries
- signals from grid

Add more paramters to determine battery efficiency:
- demand 
- weather
- location
- humidity and wind rose data
